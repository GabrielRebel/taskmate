## 🔄 **VERSION HISTORY**

### Version 1.0 - 2025-07-12 - Initial Setup
**Type**: Initial  
**Author**: VCMS Team  
**Description**: Project initialization with VCMS framework and Model Spec creation

**Changes Made**:
- [x] Project structure setup with frontend/backend separation
- [x] Model Spec creation with atomic components (CHAT-01, TASK-02, NOTIFY-03)
- [x] Multi-LLM refinement process (DeepSeek, Claude, ChatGPT)
- [x] Platform evolution strategy (Web → PWA → Cross-platform)
- [x] Anti-overreach protocols and validation hooks
- [x] Technical constraints and code quality standards

**Decisions Made**:
- **Decision 1**: Use VCMS framework for structured development → **Rationale**: Prevents scope creep and ensures quality

## 📚 **LEARNINGS LIBRARY**

### What Worked Well
- **Learning 1**: Multi-LLM refinement process → **Why**: Catches different perspectives and improves quality → **Apply to**: All future spec creation
- **Learning 2**: VCMS framework templates → **Why**: Provides structure and prevents common mistakes → **Apply to**: All project documentation
- **Learning 3**: Anti-overreach protocols → **Why**: Prevents scope creep and context bleed → **Apply to**: All AI-assisted development

### What Didn't Work
- **Issue 1**: Initial Git authentication problems → **Root Cause**: Credential mismatch between local and GitHub → **Solution**: Use consistent authentication method
- **Issue 2**: Template creation in batch vs iterative → **Root Cause**: Less depth and cross-referencing → **Solution**: Create templates one at a time with iteration
- **Issue 3**: TypeScript 5.x compatibility issues → **Root Cause**: React Scripts 5.x requires TypeScript 4.x → **Solution**: Downgrade to TypeScript 4.9.5
- **Issue 4**: AJV module dependency conflicts → **Root Cause**: React Scripts has specific AJV version requirements → **Solution**: Explicitly install ajv@8.12.0
- **Issue 5**: Missing App component error masking as dependency issue → **Root Cause**: Missing tsconfig.json file in TypeScript React project → **Solution**: Create tsconfig.json with React Scripts defaults

### Process Improvements
- **Improvement 1**: Separate PRD and Model Spec documents → **Benefit**: Clear separation of concerns → **Implementation**: Use templates for all future projects
- **Improvement 2**: Validation checklists before development → **Benefit**: Prevents common pitfalls → **Implementation**: Always create validation before building
- **Improvement 3**: Decision tracking with rationale → **Benefit**: Better future decision-making → **Implementation**: Document all decisions with reasoning
- **Improvement 4**: Dependency version documentation → **Benefit**: Prevents environment setup issues → **Implementation**: Document specific versions in project setup
- **Improvement 5**: Virtual environment management → **Benefit**: Prevents dependency conflicts across projects → **Implementation**: Use local dependencies, lock files, and isolated environments

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-13  
**Next Review**: 2025-07-20  
**Document Owner**: VCMS Team 

## [2.2.0] - 2025-07-15

### Added
- **SUCCESS**: TaskMate application successfully started and running
  - Backend: http://localhost:5000 ✅
  - Frontend: http://localhost:3001 ✅
  - All atomic components loaded successfully
- **Port Conflict Resolution**: Documented automatic port selection process
- **Development Environment**: Confirmed working setup with both servers running

### Fixed
- **Missing tsconfig.json**: Resolved "Module not found: './App'" error in frontend
- **PowerShell Command Chaining**: Documented `&&` incompatibility with PowerShell
- **NPM Script Issues**: Resolved "Missing script: 'start'" errors

### Known Issues
- **Deprecation Warnings**: 
  - `punycode` module deprecated (backend)
  - `util._extend` API deprecated (frontend)
  - Webpack dev server middleware deprecation warnings
- **Manual Startup Required**: Currently requires two separate PowerShell windows
  - Backend: `cd backend && npm start`
  - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm start` (with port conflict resolution)
- **Missing Environment Configuration**: Backend requires OpenAI API key for chat functionality
  - Issue: No .env file in backend directory
  - Solution: Copy env.example to src/backend/.env and add OpenAI API key
  - Impact: Chat interface shows typing indicator but no response

### Next Steps
- ✅ Environment file created with DeepSeek API key
- ✅ Dependencies installed (@anthropic-ai/sdk)
- ✅ Backend server running on port 5000
- ✅ Frontend server running on port 3001
- ✅ Fixed .env file path loading issue
- 🔄 Test chat functionality with DeepSeek
- 🔄 Verify AI provider service is working
- 🔄 Fix automated startup script PowerShell syntax issues

### Strategic Decision: Multi-Provider AI Architecture
**Decision**: Implement multi-provider AI architecture supporting OpenAI, Claude, and DeepSeek
**Rationale**: 
- Risk mitigation (no single point of failure)
- Cost optimization (different providers for different use cases)
- Performance optimization (best provider for each task)
- Future-proofing (easy to add new providers)

**Implementation**:
- Created AIProviderService with provider selection logic
- OpenAI: Primary for natural conversation (CHAT-01)
- Claude: Secondary for task extraction (TASK-02)
- DeepSeek: Tertiary for cost-effective operations (NOTIFY-03)
- Fallback system when providers are unavailable

### DeepSeek Configuration (Primary Provider)
**Decision**: Use DeepSeek as primary AI provider for TaskMate
**Rationale**: 
- Cost-effective (~99.5% savings vs OpenAI)
- Good conversation quality
- User has existing credits
- Supports all required use cases

**Configuration**:
- API Key: sk-4012d3212b914b39a5b52752090d7f29
- Preferred Provider: deepseek
- Model: deepseek-chat
- Endpoint: https://api.deepseek.com/v1

### Key Learnings from Development Session
- **PowerShell Limitations**: 
  - Cannot run multiple terminal sessions simultaneously
  - `&&` command chaining not supported (use separate commands)
  - Background processes don't always work reliably
- **Interactive Prompts**: Port conflict resolution requires user intervention
- **Environment Dependencies**: Backend requires AI provider API key for chat functionality
- **Proxy Configuration**: Frontend proxy correctly configured for backend communication
- **CORS Setup**: Backend has CORS enabled but needs environment variables
- **Error Patterns**: 
  - "Typing indicator but no response" = missing API key or environment config
  - "Missing script: start" = wrong directory or missing package.json
  - "&& is not a valid statement separator" = PowerShell syntax issue 

### Version 2.3 - 2025-07-13 - Migration & Major Fixes
**Type**: Migration & Fixes  
**Author**: VCMS Team  
**Description**: Moved TaskMate to standalone folder, resolved environment and communication issues, improved documentation and handoff process

**Changes Made**:
- [x] Moved project to `taskmate-standalone` directory
- [x] Recreated `.env` file in backend after move (API keys restored)
- [x] Fixed backend environment variable loading
- [x] Resolved Cursor/.cursorignore issue affecting AI features
- [x] Updated frontend to use correct backend URL/proxy
- [x] Merged and organized session summaries
- [x] Created folder move checklist for future reference

**Decisions Made**:
- **Decision 1**: Always manually recreate `.env` after moving project → **Rationale**: Prevents environment variable issues
- **Decision 2**: Document folder moves and handoff steps → **Rationale**: Ensures smooth transitions and future troubleshooting

**Learnings**:
- **Learning 1**: Hidden files like `.env` are not copied by default → **Action**: Always check and recreate after moves
- **Learning 2**: Cursor disables AI features when `.env` is present → **Action**: Use `.cursorignore` and edit `.env` outside Cursor
- **Learning 3**: Proxy settings and direct URLs both useful for frontend-backend communication → **Action**: Test both after moves
- **Learning 4**: Merging session summaries improves clarity for future handoff → **Action**: Use single, comprehensive summary per day

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Continue development in new folder structure
- [ ] Use folder move checklist for future migrations
- [ ] Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation
