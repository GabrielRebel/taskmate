# Session Summary - 2025-07-14

## Major Accomplishments

- **Backend Recovery:**
  - Discovered backend was missing critical files (package.json, server.js, ai-provider.js, validation middleware).
  - Re-initialized backend with new package.json and installed dependencies (express, cors, dotenv, sqlite3).
  - Recreated server.js to load all existing route files and start the Express server.
  - Recreated missing middleware/validation.js and services/ai-provider.js as placeholders to restore functionality.
  - Confirmed backend is now running and serving API endpoints.

- **Frontend Refactor & Progress:**
  - Set up react-router for client-side routing.
  - Refactored sidebar to use NavLink for navigation.
  - Moved chat UI to /chat route and created placeholder pages for /tasks, /calendar, /missions.
  - Installed and integrated Zustand for global state management.
  - Refactored chat logic to add extracted tasks to the global store.
  - Updated Tasks page to use Zustand store for adding and toggling tasks.

- **Technical Roadmap & Documentation:**
  - Created and updated a technical roadmap checklist in PROJECT-STATUS.md.
  - Checked off each major step as it was completed for clear progress tracking.
  - Discussed and clarified the difference between active tab navigation and route-based navigation.
  - Documented the need for improved folder move checklists to prevent future backend breakage.

- **General Improvements & Decisions:**
  - Chose to use separate pages (routing) for each major feature for scalability and UX.
  - Decided to centralize business logic (taskService) for maintainability (next step).
  - Ensured all new files are placed in the correct directories for a scalable monorepo.
  - Added placeholder logic for AI provider so the app can run even without a real LLM.

## Notes & Lessons Learned

- Always verify backend integrity after major folder moves or refactors.
- Keep session summaries and checklists up to date to avoid losing context.
- Placeholder logic is useful for keeping development unblocked when real integrations are missing.
- Documenting every major step helps with onboarding, troubleshooting, and future planning.

**Next Steps:**
- Build out centralized taskService for state-machine operations.
- Continue feature development per the technical roadmap.
- Improve folder move checklist and backup strategy.

**Tip:**  
- You can copy and paste these commands directly into your PowerShell window.
- Once in the correct directory, you can run `yarn start` or `npm start` as needed.
