## Addendum: Frontend Restoration (End of Session)

- Recovered the frontend from a broken state by recreating missing core files (public/index.html, src/index.js, src/App.js, src/index.css).
- Confirmed the React app now boots and displays in the browser.
- The app is now ready for restoring real features and UI components on top of the working foundation.
