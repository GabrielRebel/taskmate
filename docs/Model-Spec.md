# Model Spec - TaskMate

**Project Name**: TaskMate
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 7/12/25
**Last Updated**: 7/14/25
**Status**: In Development
**PRD Version**: [Link to approved PRD]

## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
- **Technology Stack:**
  - Frontend: React + TypeScript
  - Backend: Node.js + Express
  - Database: LocalStorage (MVP), future: SQLite or cloud
  - Deployment: Manual, local-first, future: cloud
- **Platform Strategy:**
  - Phase 1: Web app (desktop/mobile responsive)
  - Phase 2: PWA/mobile optimization
  - Phase 3: Native app (future)

---

## 🗂️ Repository Strategy
- **Type:** Monorepo
- **Why:** Easier code sharing between web, mobile, and backend; simpler dependency management; synchronized releases and shared documentation
- **Tooling:** Yarn Workspaces (for package management and monorepo support)

## 🔧 ATOMIC COMPONENTS

### Component 1: Calendar Integration
- **Purpose:** Display and manage tasks/goals on a calendar UI
- **Input:** Task data, user actions (add/edit/delete)
- **Output:** Calendar UI updates, notifications
- **Dependencies:** date-fns or similar, localStorage
- **Atomic Scope:** Cannot manage habits or chat threads
- **Acceptance Criteria:** User can add/view/edit/delete tasks on a calendar; UI updates instantly
- **Testing/Validation:** Manual UI test, add/view/remove task, check calendar updates
- **Out-of-Scope:** Calendar sync with Google/Outlook (future)
- **Risks/Assumptions:** User will not have more than 100 tasks per month

### Component 2: Habit Tracker (Gamified)
- **Purpose:** Track daily habits and gamify with streaks (like Duolingo)
- **Input:** User habit actions (check-in, mark complete)
- **Output:** Streak count, gamified feedback (badges, streaks)
- **Dependencies:** LocalStorage, React state
- **Atomic Scope:** Cannot manage calendar or chat threads
- **Acceptance Criteria:** User can create habits, see/update streaks, receive feedback
- **Testing/Validation:** Manual test: create habit, mark complete, streak increases; streak resets if missed
- **Out-of-Scope:** Social/sharing features
- **Risks/Assumptions:** User will interact daily; streak logic must handle time zones

### Component 3: Chat Thread Management
- **Purpose:** Save, organize, and folder chat threads for easy retrieval
- **Input:** Chat data, user actions (save, move, delete, create folder)
- **Output:** Organized chat threads, folder structure
- **Dependencies:** LocalStorage, React state
- **Atomic Scope:** Cannot manage tasks or habits
- **Acceptance Criteria:** User can save threads, create folders, move threads, retrieve/view saved threads
- **Testing/Validation:** Manual test: save thread, create folder, move thread, retrieve thread
- **Out-of-Scope:** Cloud sync, team sharing
- **Risks/Assumptions:** User will not create more than 50 folders/threads
